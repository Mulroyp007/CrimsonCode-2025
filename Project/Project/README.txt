Pixels to Sound Player



***************************************************

Description: 
	Our project reads in pixels from a png or jpg image and plays set sounds based on data
	from the pixels. The data from the pixels being analyzed includes RGB values, brightness, and 'scatter' values.
	The Pixels to Sound Player is supposed to provide entertainment for the user because they can see
	if a particular image 'sounds' good.

In progress Implementation:
	We will store pixels in a 2d array of structs that is dynamically allocated.

	Uninplemented plans: Read in each pixel and play a sound depending on the data. 
	Modify the sound based on environmental factors.

	-analyze brightness and most common color for and have those equate to certain sounds, play with a predefined rhythm
